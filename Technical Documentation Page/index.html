                <p><h2>What exactly is Data Science?</h2> <br>
                    Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making. <br>
                    
                    Data Science is about finding patterns in data, through analysis, and make future predictions. <br>
                    
                    By using Data Science, companies are able to make:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Better decisions (should we choose A or B)</li>
                    <li>Predictive analysis (what will happen next?)</li>
                    <li>Pattern discoveries (find pattern, or maybe hidden information in the data)</li></ul></p> <br>
                <p><h2>Where is Data Science Needed?</h2>
                    Data Science can be applied in nearly every part of a business where data is available. <br>
                    Examples are:
                    <ul><li>Consumer goods
                        <li>Stock markets
                        <li>Industry
                        <li>Politics
                        <li>Logistic companies
                        <li>E-commerce</li></ul></p>
                <p><h2>How Does a Data Scientist Work?</h2>
                    A Data Scientist requires expertise in several backgrounds: <br>
                    
                    <ul><li>Machine Learning</li> <br>
                    <li>Statistics </li><br>
                    <li>Programming (Python or R)</li> <br>
                    <li>Mathematics</li> <br>
                    <li>Databases </li></ul> <br>
                    A Data Scientist must find patterns within the data. Before he/she can find the patterns, he/she must organize the data in a standard format.
                    
                    Here is how a Data Scientist works: <br>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Ask the right questions - To understand the business problem.</li><br>
                    <li>Explore and collect data - From database, web logs, customer feedback, etc.</li><br>
                    <li>Extract the data - Transform the data to a standardized format.</li><br>
                    <li>Clean the data - Remove erroneous values from the data.</li><br>
                    <li>Find and replace missing values - Check for missing values and replace them with a suitable value (e.g. an average value).</li><br>
                    <li>Normalize data - Scale the values in a practical range (e.g. 140 cm is smaller than 1,8 m. However, the number 140 is larger than 1,8. - so scaling is important).</li><br>
                    <li>Analyze data, find patterns and make future predictions.</li><br>
                    <li>Represent the result - Present the result with useful insights in a way the "company" can understand.</li></ol><br>
                <p>

                <h2>How to Become a Data Scientist </h2>
                By now, you’re likely eager to get started on your journey to becoming a data scientist. But where to start? <br> 
                Below, we’ve highlighted eight steps you need to take to become a data scientist from scratch. <br>

                As we’ve discussed already, the exact data scientist requirements will depend on a variety of factors, but these are some of the most commonly cited steps: <br>
                <p><ol>
                <li><h3> Learn data wrangling, data visualization, and reporting</h3> 
                As you work to become a data scientist, you’ll often encounter large and complex datasets. To make sense of this information (for yourself and others), you’ll need to learn how to deal with it. <br>
                This is where skills in data wrangling come in handy. This is where you’ll clean, organize, and transform raw data into a format you can analyze and draw conclusions from. 

                There are various tools you can use with data wrangling, but libraries like pandas in Python are often the go-to choice. You can check out our data wrangling in Python with pandas cheat sheet for more info. 

                When it comes to presenting your data with impact, you’ll need to master reporting and data visualization. You can find out more about some of the best data visualization tools out there, giving you a range of options depending on your ultimate goal.</li> 

                <li><h3> Work on your statistics, math, and machine learning skills </h3>
                While you don’t necessarily need a degree that covers these fields, you do need a functional knowledge of these areas. Generally, you’ll want to cover areas such as calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. However, it’s worth assessing your intent behind learning these things. 

                For example, learning calculus can help you learn to create optimization algorithms for machine learning, although there are functions in both Python and R that can take care of the calculus for you. As a specific example, understanding a topic like gradient descent can help you measure the change in a function’s output when you tweak the inputs, which can help to refine machine learning models. 

                If you’re looking to brush up on your linear algebra skills, our Linear Algebra for Data Science in R course can help you work with vectors and matrices, solve matrix-vector equations, perform eigenvalue/eigenvector analyses and use principal component analysis to do dimension reduction on real-world datasets. These areas are all useful for applied mathematics and data science. 

                Similarly, Intermediate Statistical Modeling in R covers some of the essential machine learning statistics topics, helping you make progress in key areas. </li>

               <li><h3> Learn to code </h3>
                In our article on the top programming languages for data scientists, we explore in detail some of the best languages you should consider learning right now. Two of the most obvious choices for data scientists are Python and R, given their versatility and ubiquity. 

                Of course, working with data also means working with databases, so SQL is another essential programming language. Thankfully, it’s a relatively straightforward language once you’ve learned Python and R. 

                Julia is a good choice once you’ve learned Python, R and SQL. With Julia, you get a language that’s built from the ground up for data science, making it fast and intuitive.  If you start working with very big data sets, you may need other languages, but until then, these four will be sufficient.

                With a language like Java, you get an open-source language known for it’s efficiency and performance. For data science, Java Virtual Machines provide a solid and efficient framework for popular big data tools, such as Hadoop, Spark, and Scala. 

                Other coding languages worth learning for data science with very large data sets include Scala, C/C++, JavaScript, Swift, Go, MATLAB and SAS. </li>

                <li><h3> Understand databases </h3>
                We mentioned SQL in the topic above, and it’s a point that bears repeating. Relational databases allow data scientists to store structured data in a fast and efficient way. When collecting and organizing data, you’ll often find that SQL is your preferred tool here. 

                SQL allows you to handle structured data, query databases, wrangle, prepare, and experiment with data, and more. What’s more, SQL is often deployed alongside Python, with libraries such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL helping you connect different data sources. </li>

                <li><h3>Learn to work with big data  </h3>
                We’ve already touched briefly on the fact that, as a data scientist, you’ll often be working with large sets of data. In an era where everything and everyone is producing more data than ever before, these data sets are increasingly huge, making them harder to collect, maintain and process. 

                Yet from these huge data sets, a skilled data scientist can extract new and detailed insights. So, learning to use cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud can all benefit your career as a data scientis. Similarly, tools like Apache Spark can help with big data processing, analysis and machine learning. 

                You can learn the big data fundamentals with PySpark with our course, which covers some of the essentials when dealing with large amounts of data for analysis.  </li>

                <li><h3> Get experience, practice, and meet fellow data scientists</h3> 
                As with any career, to become a data scientist, you’ll need as much experience and practice as possible. Luckily, there are many ways that you can get involved with communities, work on projects, and develop your data science skills. 

                For example, DataCamp Workspace provides a collaborative cloud-based notebook that allows you to analyze data, collaborate with others, and share insights. Workspace is designed to take you from learning data science to doing data science. It also has built-in datasets, so you can start analyzing data within minutes.

                You can also apply your knowledge to various data science projects, allowing you to solve real-world problems from your browser.</li> 

                <li><h3> Take an internship or apply for a job </h3>
                Once you’ve developed all of the skills mentioned above, you’ll want to start applying them in more professional settings. Once you’re confident you have the data scientist skills needed to meet the expectations of a role, you can start applying for internships or jobs. 

                Check out our full guide on applying for data science jobs and learn how to set yourself apart from other candidates. You’ll likely need a fairly thorough portfolio demonstrating a range of skills, and you’ll also need to prepare for the data scientist interview ahead of time. </li>

                <li><h3> Follow and engage with the community</h3> 
                If you want to become a data scientist, you’re going to need to keep up-to-date with a fast-paced industry. There is no better way to stay informed about developments in data science than by engaging with what can often be a generous and dedicated community.</ol></p> 

                As well as social media sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, there are all kinds of niche sites, blogs, and data science leaders you can follow. Look for people who are interested in the same areas as you, reach out for advice and contribute to discussions, and get involved with what’s going on. And, of course, check out the DataFramed Podcast to get industry news from a host of data professionals.</li></ol></p>
